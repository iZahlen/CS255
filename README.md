   * Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    The DriverPass project was essentially a job to... build a website that would allow the client to host and manage driving lessons etc. 
    I'd say the part I did the best with was the general flowcharts and what not. 
    
   *  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    My diagrams, particularly the UML Use Case Diagram while functionally sound, would benefit greatly from being expanded on. Not necessarily bad but I feel I put the bare minimum into it for it to be properly... understood? 
    
   *  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I kind of just tried to impliment the ideas in a way that would make it mesh well with the systems. for example, the user needed the site to be accessible by the largest amount of people therefore the best platform to build it upon would be web-based like a website or such. I think it kind of speaks for itself but you're building something FOR the user so their needs are basically the top priority after getting the project itself up and running. 
    
   *  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    
    I'd say in the future... I could definitely see myself using the use cases and stuff we went over.
